Some useful links:

Itertools / numpy / pandas
 
https://towardsdatascience.com/tour-of-python-itertools-2af84db18a5e
These are built-in and provide more methods to sort, operate on data collections. For example, compress, map_reduce etc.
Please, note that simple methods, such as filter, map, reduce are built-in to the language, you don’t need to import itertools
to use them.
 
If you install https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ these packages and some others for data science will be available.
For example if you’d like to use pandas, you can install it via: 
conda install pandas
